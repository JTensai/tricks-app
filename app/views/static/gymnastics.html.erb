      <p>Gymnastics is the most comprehensive "lifestyle exercise program" available to children.  This amazing and challenging sport develops strength, flexibility and speed.  You’ll see a difference within the first month of your child coming to TRICKS!  Confidence begins to grow as challenges are met and conquered, new muscles are fired up as your child begins to discover all the things they are capable of.</p>
      <p>TRICKS has a different theme each week and all of the skills on your child’s take home skill poster are worked into the lesson plans every month. We want to add value to your experience here by teaching life skills like gratitude, courage, honesty, (to name a few).  It’s not easy to do all of this in an hour and half but our coaches are amazing.  They are excellent role models, smart, kind and happy to talk with the parent.  You are welcome to stay and watch from our comfortable viewing stands.</p>
